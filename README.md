# Cognition
Facial Recognition based on Concurrent Neural Networks

Uses OPENCV for Computer Vision to grab faces from images/video.
Runs faces against a CNN to identify the person.

To-Do:
Convert CNN to CapsNet based on "Dynamic Routing Between Capsules" paper.
Optimize OEPNCV cascade with custom cascade for better performance


Stretch Goals:
Break away from OPENCV and transition to a CNN/CapsNet trained Computer Vision Engine
